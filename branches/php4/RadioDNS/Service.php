/**
 * PHP-RadioDNS
 * A PHP library that facilitates the resolution of an authoritative Fully 
 * Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) from the broadcast parameters of an audio 
 * service.
 * From this FQDN it is then possible to discover the advertisement of IP-based
 * applications provided in relation to the queried audio service.
 * For more information about RadioDNS, please see the official documentation:
